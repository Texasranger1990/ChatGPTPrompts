Can you tell me, what the following regex is testing for?

```
\b[\w.!#$%&’*+\/=?^`{|}~-]+@[\w-]+(?:\.[\w-]+)*\b
```

The given regular expression is testing for email addresses. Let's break it down into its components:

1. \b: Matches a word boundary, ensuring that the pattern starts at the beginning of a word.
2. [\w.!#$%&’\*+\/=?^{|}\~-]+: Matches one or more occurrences of word characters (letters, digits, or underscore) along with a set of special characters: dot (.), exclamation mark (!), hash (#), dollar sign ($), percent sign (%), ampersand (&), single quote (’), asterisk (*), plus sign (+), forward slash (/), equals sign (=), question mark (?), caret (^), backtick (\\), vertical bar (|), tilde (~), or hyphen (-). This part matches the local part of the email address before the @` symbol.
3. @: Matches the @ symbol.
4. [\w-]+: Matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscore) or hyphens (-). This part matches the domain name before the top-level domain (TLD) portion of the email address.
5. (?:\.[\w-]+)*: Matches zero or more occurrences of a dot (.) followed by one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscore) or hyphens (-). This part allows for subdomains or additional domain levels.
6. \b: Matches a word boundary, ensuring that the pattern ends at the end of a word.

In summary, the regular expression is testing for strings that resemble email addresses, making sure they have a valid format with the local part, @ symbol, domain name, and optional subdomains. However, it's worth noting that this regular expression is a simplified form of email address validation and may not account for all possible variations of valid email addresses or consider domain-specific rules.
